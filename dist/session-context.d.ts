/**
 * Session-start context.
 *
 * Rules and handoffs only helped when the agent remembered to ask for them, and
 * measured over a day it did not: a rule set at importance 0.95 that morning was
 * never queried that afternoon, and the mistake it described was made again. So
 * the store now pushes instead of waiting to be pulled. A SessionStart hook runs
 * this once and prints it, and Claude Code adds the output to the session's
 * context before the first message.
 *
 * Four sections, each capped, all of it capped again as a whole so a large
 * store cannot flood the window:
 *
 *   1. The latest handoff, or the rolling crash checkpoint if that is newer.
 *   2. Procedural rules, top by confidence.
 *   3. Corrections and preferences with high importance: the things the user
 *      said after something went wrong.
 *   4. Memories whose domain matches the working directory's name.
 *
 * Nothing here needs an LLM. If the store is missing or unreadable the caller
 * prints nothing and exits clean; a memory problem must never block a session.
